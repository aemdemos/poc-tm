<div><h2 id="section-rules">Section Rules</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Blockers &#x26; Open Problems:</strong> Only shown when problems exist with <code>Resolved? = no</code> or <code>workaround</code>, or when <code>project-context.md</code> has active blockers. Otherwise skip entirely — don't show an empty section.</li>
<li><strong>Resume Point:</strong> Copy the carry-forward verbatim. This is the single most important line in the briefing.</li>
<li><strong>Project Status:</strong> Keep the pending list to 3-4 items maximum. If there are more, pick the highest priority.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Show last 1-2 sessions only. More than that is noise.</li>
<li><strong>Time &#x26; Metrics:</strong> One line per metric. Pull from <code>metrics.md</code> and <code>time-tracking.md</code> header.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention Reminders:</strong> Pick items relevant to what's coming next, not the full checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Next Steps:</strong> Be specific. "Continue migration" is too vague. "Extract design tokens from zelis.com and populate styles/styles.css" is actionable.</li>

<div><h2 id="example">Example</h2><pre><code class="language-markdown">## Status Checkup — Zelis EDS Migration
**As of:** 2026-02-26 (Session 008)
**Branch:** `issue-1-styles-bulk`

---

### Resume Point

> Time tracking skill v1.1 complete. All three supporting skills operational.
> Next priorities: design token extraction from zelis.com, navigation structure
> setup, or begin bulk page migration.

---

### Project Status

- **Overall:** Early migration — homepage blocks functional, animation skill built, tooling refined
- **Done:** 11 items — repo setup, block imports, hero Lottie, animation skill, journaling, problem tracker, time tracking
- **In progress:** none — between sessions
- **Pending:**
  - Design token extraction (colors, fonts, spacing → `styles/styles.css`)
  - Navigation setup (nav.md/nav.html from zelis.com structure)
  - Block styling refinement (CSS doesn't match source site)
  - Additional page migrations (~789 URLs remain)

---

### Recent Activity

- **Session 008** — Refine time tracking skill v1.1 (~17m) — Merged 6 improvements from external skill
- **Session 007** — Create time tracking skill (~22m) — Skill + initial report + format schema

---

### Time &#x26; Metrics

- **Sessions:** 9 total (8 today)
- **Time invested:** ~9h 55m agent / ~10h 57m with margin
- **Success rate:** 97% first-try (65 actions)
- **Problems:** 6 encountered, 6 resolved, 0 open

---

### Prevention Reminders

- Match DA links by `a.textContent`, never by `a.href` (DA-001)
- Set `HOME=/home/node` before git commands in container (GIT-001)
- Never manually write `.html` files that have a `.md` source (SYNC-001)

---

### Suggested Next Steps

1. Extract design tokens from zelis.com — populate `styles/styles.css` with colors, fonts, spacing
2. Set up navigation structure — build nav.md/nav.html from zelis.com site map
3. Begin bulk page migration — set up page templates and import scripts for remaining ~789 URLs
